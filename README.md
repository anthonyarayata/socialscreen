Currently being refactored, the web extension might not be usable for now.

## Introduction
SocialScreen, previously named Filterino, is a Chromium browser extension designed to filter unwanted content in social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. It removes the posts by manipulating the HTML document of a website. This means that does not directly interact with the users' social media accounts, only the HTML document which allows them to see the posts in their feed. SocialScreen also has limited filtering functions for Reddit, and other websites


## Installation Guide
SocialScreen is currently in "pending review" status in the Chrome Web Store.

## User Guide
SocialScreen is easy to use as the UI is pretty self explanatory but we will still enumerate them: 
1. Click on the SocialScreen icon to open the UI.
2. Click on the checkbox of the desired filter.
3. Click on Apply Filters to remove posts. (You do not have to refresh the website for this)
4. If you want to add a custom filter, enter the desired text in the text field and click on "Add".
5. You can also add a custom filter while the Custom Filter checkbox is ticked, what this does is automatically apply newly added word for filtering.
6. If number 5 doesn't happen, just click "Apply Filters".
7. Click on "Show Custom Filters" to see the custom filters added. (Remember duplicates can be added but do not worry as it will not really affect the web extension).
8. To remove a filter click the "x" button on the opposite side of the word you desire.
9. Removing a custom filter will not bring back the posts removed and you will have to refresh the page to see them again.
